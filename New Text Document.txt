Based on the "Be Legal" logo's color scheme, I recommend the following website color palette:

### **Primary Color (Main Brand Color)**
- **Rust Brown** (#A15C3E) – Taken from the logo to maintain brand consistency.

### **Secondary Colors (Supporting & Accent Colors)**
- **Beige/Sand** (#F5EDE1) – A soft, neutral background color to enhance readability.
- **Dark Brown** (#5E3C2C) – A rich, deep brown for headings and emphasis.
- **Gold/Amber** (#D4A76A) – A luxurious accent color for buttons and highlights.

### **Neutral Colors (Backgrounds & Text)**
- **White** (#FFFFFF) – Clean and professional for main content areas.
- **Light Gray** (#EAEAEA) – Subtle contrast for secondary sections.

Would you like a website mockup based on this palette?
